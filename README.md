# Squad-Labs

My attempt at making a multi-level database. I've created a PostgreSQL database with two tables, squads and the students in them. The purpose of this app is to allow the user to manipulate btoh the students and squads with Sinatra. One can add a new student, remove, or edit it's properties. They can do the same with the squads.
